<p id="intro">My name is Nick. I am a young game developer.  I hope to work in computers when I start work, either as a game developer or as a computer programmer.<br>

I have been interested in computers all my life.  I am especially interested in developing games and building websites such as this one.
I started coding after I had been given a book on coding. The first product I came up with was a small password lock. Since then, I have produced a game that is available on the Play store â€“ BLOCKTOPIA. This was developed using the Unity coding platform.  
My favorite games include Minecraft, Roblox, Fractal Space and X Survive.
